In April 2020 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52279973) police had spoken to thousands of people for flouting social distancing rules over the Easter bank holiday weekend.

They include a couple from Hertfordshire who drove to Brighton to walk on the beach and a family from London who drove to the Lake District.

Essex Police said it had spoken to about 1,600 people over the weekend for making inappropriate journeys.

Other police forces, however, thanked the public for observing the rules.
