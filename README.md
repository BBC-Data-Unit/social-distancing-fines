In April 2020 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52279973) police had spoken to thousands of people for flouting social distancing rules over the Easter bank holiday weekend.

They included a couple from Hertfordshire who drove to Brighton to walk on the beach and a family from London who drove to the Lake District.

Other police forces, however, thanked the public for observing the rules.

The National Police Chiefâ€™s Council released data the day after our report on the number of people fined for breaching social distancing rules between 27 March and 13 April.

We calculted the rate of fines per 10,000 people in each police force area. The most fines - proportionally - were issued in coastal areas - North Yorkshire, Devon, Cornwall, Cleveland and Lancashire.
